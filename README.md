# surf
Lightweight webserver. Can be used standalone or with another webserver (eg nginx) using a reverse-proxy.

## Requirements
`Node.js 15+` and `uuigen` on your system's `PATH` (most unix-like systems have this already... not sure about Windows ðŸ‘€)

## Setup
Either start a new project and include `SKYCRATE-ltd/surf` as a dependency or clone this repo and run `npm i`. That should be all.

## Chat Server Example
See the `test.js` file in the root directory and run `node test.js` to see it in action.
